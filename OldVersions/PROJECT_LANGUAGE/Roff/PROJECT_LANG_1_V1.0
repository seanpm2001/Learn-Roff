//Project language file 1
//For: seanpm2001/Learn-Roff
//About:
//I decided to make Roff the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Roff) as Roff is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Roff programming language. It only makes sense to make Roff the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
